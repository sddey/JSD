JUNIOR SOFTWEAR DEVELOPER   COURSE_JAVA
A junior software developer is a software professional who is at the beginning of their career and is typically in an entry-level position. They work with senior developers to create, test, and maintain software applications.

Junior software developers typically have a basic understanding of programming languages, software development principles, and software development processes. They may have some experience working on small projects or completing coursework related to software development.

In a software development team, junior developers are often responsible for coding, debugging, and testing software features, as well as maintaining and updating existing code. They may also work on documentation, such as user manuals and technical specifications.

As they gain more experience, junior developers may take on more responsibility and work more independently, taking ownership of specific features or modules of a larger application. They may also participate in code reviews and collaborate with other developers to solve more complex problems.

Overall, a junior software developer is an important member of a software development team and plays a critical role in the development of software applications. With time and experience, they can develop the skills and knowledge needed to advance in their careers and become more senior developers.
